# LLMs from the Ground Up

Wherein I code up a basic LLM from scratch in Python, in Jupyter notebooks.

This project uses `uv` to manage dependencies. See the `Makefile` for creating an `ipykernel` for the notebooks in here and running things in general.

I use the Gutenberg texts of the King James Bible as a corpus. The generative AI in here just uses the four books of the Gospels. Not evangelizing, it's just a text I know well. :)

## uv and Jupyter Notebook

Some of what is here is for me to learn using the `uv` build tool with Jupyter notebooks.
